# Raspberry-Pi-Firewall
I set up a Raspberry Pi 3B+ as a home firewall using IPfire, turning it into a key security component for my network. The goal was to create a lab environment that I can expand in the future.

## Project Highlight
- Firewall Setup – Configured the Raspberry Pi as a firewall to control and monitor network traffic.

- Router Integration – Connected the firewall to a router, transforming it into a router with WiFi access behind a firewall.

- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) – Integrated Snort with VRT GPLv2 Community Rules to detect and prevent potential threats in real time.

- Future Expansion – I plan to implement OpenVPN for secure remote access and a web proxy for better traffic control and privacy.

- Hardware: Raspberry pi 3b+, Router , USB to RJ45 , SD Card.
- Software: IPFire 2.29 (aarch64) , BalenaEtcher(flashing OS)
